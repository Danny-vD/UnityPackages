Description:
GridCreator creates the Grid from the GridData (by using the TileTypePrefabs scriptable asset)

GridUtil tells GridCreator to create the grid on Awake and can provide information about a given GridPosition
GridUtil is also used to tell the GridCreator to instead setup a pre-generated grid

GridModifier is a tool that allows you to change TileTypes by selecting tiles in the viewport
